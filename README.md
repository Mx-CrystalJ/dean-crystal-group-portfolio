### Colors

![Color](Color Image)


While silver isn't explicitly prominent in the logo, as an accent it can complement the existing palette.

- Text and icons: Use silver for headings, subheadings, and icons to create contrast against the darker primary color.
- Dividers and separators: Employ thin silver lines to separate content sections, creating visual breaks without harsh lines.
- Hover effects: Apply a subtle silver hover effect to buttons or interactive elements, adding a touch of sophistication.
- Background accents: Consider using a subtle silver gradient or pattern for specific sections to add depth without overwhelming the design.

For Text/Icons:

- #C0C0C0 (Classic Silver): A standard, neutral silver.
- #BDBDBD (Slightly Darker): Offers a bit more contrast against the light gray.
- #D3D3D3 (Light Silver): Subtle, good for backgrounds or hover effects.

For Dividers/Subtle Accents:

- #E6E6E6 (Matches your existing light gray): Creates separation without harsh contrast.
- #EEEEEE (Slightly lighter): Very subtle, good for barely-there lines.

For Hover Effects:

- #F2F2F2 (Very Light Silver): Adds a gentle shimmer on interaction.
- #C0C0C0 Use a semi-transparent white with a hint of the classic silver  mixed in for a glowing effect.


To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.
<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

#### Main Palette

- Primary: Dark blue (#003366)
- Secondary: Light blue (#6699cc), Light gray (#e6e6e6)
- Accent: Silver
- White (#ffffff)
- Black (#000000)
